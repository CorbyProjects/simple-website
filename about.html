		<p>Years of study and training in psychology and cognitive neuroscience have helped me develop discipline and stuff. This will eventually have something professional that describes my background & makes sense of my career change so it seems logical and not desparate. Probably mentioning something about how much I enjoyed my programming classes. And liking the idea of my thing being accesible online to the world. It seems so much less restrictive than having to compile & install on standalone machines. With the online developments web apps can be so much more than they used to be.</p>
		
		<p>My goals, maybe goals paragraph should go first, before past. You know, whole future first thing? We perceive time as linear, so it feels as though past should come first, but time really isn't linear, and maybe I can even make it some kind of neat circular thing.</p>
		
		<p>By having a last 3rd paragraph that ties past & future together for present. Wow. So deep.</p>

		<h2>Hobbies/Personal Interests</h2>
		<p>When not working on sites, I love spending time with animals and gardening. I am learning how to care for orchids and bonsai. Hence my interest in a making a bonsai log. I also appreciate plants in general, and enjoy taking blurry, slightly off-center pictures at botanical gardens and walking trails. Maybe I'll add some of the less-terrible pictures here.</p>
